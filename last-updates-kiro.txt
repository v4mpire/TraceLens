implemented: browser SDK, server SDK, ingestion service, analysis engine, security scanner, and web 
dashboard. The system successfully builds and runs with Docker Compose.
- **Key Strengths**: 
  - Complete end-to-end data pipeline from SDKs to dashboard
  - All 13 development checkpoints completed (100%)
  - Production-ready with <1ms overhead guarantees
  - Modern UI with comprehensive design system
- **Missing Functionality**: Minor - no demo video present, some advanced features planned but not 
implemented (Python SDK, ML insights)

Real-World Value (15/15)  
- **Problem Being Solved**: Revolutionary approach to observability - focuses on causality rather than 
metrics, eliminates tool sprawl, reduces MTTR for performance issues
- **Target Audience**: Web developers and engineering teams building modern applications who need 
deterministic performance analysis
- **Practical Applicability**: Exceptional - addresses real pain points in production debugging, designed 
for AI-assisted development workflows, self-hosted for privacy

Code Quality (8/10)
- **Architecture**: Excellent microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns, proper 
TypeScript usage throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful shutdown, health checks, and proper HTTP 
status codes
- **Code Clarity**: Well-organized monorepo structure, consistent naming conventions, comprehensive type 
definitions
- **Areas for Improvement**: Some packages could use more comprehensive unit test coverage
