> Perfect! 🎉 I've successfully updated all documentation files with the published NPM package information
and added GitHub collapsibles for better organization. Here's what was accomplished:

- **Installation Commands**: Updated with actual npm install -g @tracelens/mcp-server
- **Real Usage Examples**: Concrete examples using the published package

### 📚 Enhanced Documentation Structure
- **GitHub Collapsibles**: Added <details> sections to all major documentation files
- **Improved Readability**: Reduced visual overwhelm while maintaining comprehensive information
- **Better Organization**: Grouped related content into expandable sections

### 🔄 Updated Files
1. QUICKSTART.md: Complete rewrite with published package and collapsible sections
2. DEVLOG.md: Added publication status and enhanced with collapsibles
3. DEVELOPMENT-JOURNEY.md: Updated with NPM publication milestone and cost/time savings data
4. CHECKPOINTS.md: Reflected published MCP integration status
5. docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md: Comprehensive update with detailed usage examples and collapsibles

The documentation now presents TraceLens as a mature, production-ready platform with published NPM 
packages and comprehensive AI tool integration. Users can easily find what they need without being 
overwhelmed by too much information at once.
