> Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the "Self-Monitoring TraceLens with 
Interactive Onboarding & Enhanced Installer" feature. This plan builds directly on the context from our 
previous conversation and incorporates the Rich library research.

## Key Highlights of the Plan:

### 🎯 Core Concept
Transform TraceLens into a self-observing platform where the dashboard monitors its own performance in 
real-time, creating a "meta" observability experience that immediately demonstrates the platform's 
capabilities.

### 🚀 Three Major Components

1. Self-Monitoring System: Creates an immutable __SYSTEM__ project that tracks the dashboard's own 
performance
2. Enhanced Installer: Rich terminal UI with multi-stage progress bars, live package updates, and beautiful
success screens
3. Interactive Onboarding: 3-step wizard guiding users through health checks, dashboard tour, and 
integration

### 📊 Rich Library Integration
Based on the research, the enhanced installer will use:
- Progress class for multiple concurrent tasks
- SpinnerColumn, BarColumn, TextColumn for rich progress display
- Live package name updates during npm/build processes
- Beautiful success screens with service status tables

### 🔧 Implementation Strategy
- **16 atomic tasks** in dependency order
- **5-level validation** from syntax to performance
- **Comprehensive testing** including visual regression
- **Zero regression guarantee** with existing functionality

### 💡 Immediate Value
- Judges see TraceLens monitoring itself with real data
- Developers experience professional installation process
- Users get guided tour showing exact capabilities
- 80% reduction in AI debugging costs through precise context

The plan follows the systematic development approach established in our previous work and ensures the 
feature delivers immediate, demonstrable value while maintaining TraceLens's core principles of 
performance and reliability.

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan, or would you prefer to review and 
refine the approach first?
